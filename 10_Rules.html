<h1> 10 Principles of Design </h1>
	

<body>
<p> 1. "Good Design is innovative." I've applied this rule within a lot of my work. I think it is a <em>key</em> rule. </p>
<p> 2. "Good Design makes a product useful." This is a rule that I used specifically in my freshman drawing class where we had to design a new product based off an item we chose with features that we thought would be useful or important. </p>
<p> 3. "Good Design is aesthetic." I believe I use this rule a lot in all of my work as I am already someone who enjoys the aesthetics and everything correlating together. </p>
<p> 4. "Good Design makes a product understandable." As I mentioned before, in my freshman drawing class we had to design something based off a product of our choosing. I had chosen a mouse and had added some key features I thought were important, so to do this I had to make a clear cut design that was easily understandable.</p>
<p> 5. "Good Design is unobtrusive." I can honestly say I'm not sure if I have or have not applied this rule in my designs. If I have, it may have been without knowing it.</p>
<p> 6. "Good Design is honest." I havedefinitely applied this rule a lot in my work. The way I look at it is that with my designs I'm not exaggerating anything. Everything is as it seems. </p>
<p> 7. "Good Design is long-lasting." I think this is a really important rule to remember. As Dieter stated, designs in fashion go out of date very quickly so it's important to remember to create something unique that'll never truly be "out of date".</p>
<p> 8. "Good Design is thorough down to detail." This rule I've used a lot in my work. I'm very careful and precise when it comes to working on projects, and I make sure to check that everything is accurate before showing my work. </p>
<p> 9. "Good Design is enviroment friendly." I'm honestly not sure if or how I've ever applied this rule to my designs! </p>
<p> 10. "Good Design is as little design as possible." I've applied this rule in some of my work. I will admit sometimes when desigining I think I go a little above and beyond when it's really not necessary, so I keep this rule in the back of my head to always remember!</p>
